# hello-world

A repository created by Michael Siddiqui for practice on command line git version control manipulations. Contains the weather Python package and the weather\_script.py Python script.

## packages

weather

### weather

weather is a Python package containing code to extract weather and temperature data from the wunderground REST endpoint based on user-supplied location information. Useful learning exercise for reading a new site's API documentation, writing code using requests to interact with a REST endpoint and extract specific information. Also useful to learn how to set credentials to an environment variable to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in modules.

## scripts

weather\_script.py - enables command-line execution of the 'check\_the\_weather' function from the weather package. Useful exercise for demonstrating how 'def main()' is useful in scripts that pull most functionality from code in packages or modules.
